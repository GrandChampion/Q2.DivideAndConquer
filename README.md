# Divide and conquer

## Key idea
- Divide into sub array
- Initialize what does the function from sub array will return as API
```python
A = List[0:5]
B = List[5:10]
sortedA = sort(A) #API: after the function, list will be sorted
sortedB = sort(B) #API: after the function, list will be sorted
```
- Focus on what is returned
- Focus and what is the input of the function

## Warning
- Don't track the code.
- Only track code when analyzing the runtime of the code.

## Four main Divide and conquer algorithm
1. Merge sort
2. Quick sort
3. Binary search
4. Closest point
